      <p class="about-text">The final project explores how the city acts as a living canvas for creativity, influencing art, music, design, and the experiences collected through travel. As a creative who has traveled and spent time in different places, I’ve seen firsthand how every city carries its own personality, ambitions, and cultural heartbeat. In the United States especially, each city holds a unique lifestyle and identity that shapes our generation’s creativity and plays a pivotal role in hip-hop culture. This site brings those influences together, showing how movement through different urban spaces fuels artistic expression and connects place with creative identity.</p>
      <p class="about-text">Each internal page reflects a different layer of how creativity and city life connect. The Art page features four personal pieces I created while spending time in the city; work shaped by the people, energy, and visual culture surrounding me. The Music page showcases three of my favorite albums, each different in sound yet deeply similar in how they influence city communities and remain influential across our generation. The Blog page acts as a reflection space, documenting my experiences traveling from state to state and exploring how each location offers its own landscape, culture, and stories. Together, these pages illustrate how art, music, and lived experiences across cities fuel my creative perspective.</p>
