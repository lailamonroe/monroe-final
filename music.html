        <h3>Tyler, the Creator</h3>
        <p>The city and the world become a canvas, an open art gallery through Tyler’s concept. Art becomes an exploration of self-identity, shaped by different locations that represent distinct experiences: reinvention, escape, romance, and personal evolution. The city is built on rhythms such as bustling traffic, transit, and constant motion, which Tyler captures through the pacing of the songs, the energy, and the album’s lost-and-found theme. Ironically, many assume the album is inspired by <em>The Darjeeling Limited (2007)</em> because of its similar themes of travel and its focus on luggage and movement. The film is known for Wes Anderson’s visual aesthetic, which overlaps with Tyler’s use of pastels, vintage travel motifs, luggage imagery, and Louis Vuitton inspired styling.</p>

        <h3>Bad Bunny</h3>
        <p>The album highlights the connection between urban spaces, from Puerto Rico’s vibrant city life to larger cities like Milwaukee and Los Angeles. Across the world, cities serve as multicultural spaces where art and a lively urban heartbeat collide. The project blends a wide range of genres: reggaetón, trap Latino, dancehall, indie rock, electro-pop, and perreo club beats. These sounds are drawn directly from city streets, block parties, and late-night nightlife, making it clear that the city functions as a soundscape rather than just a backdrop throughout every beat.</p>

        <h3>J. Cole</h3>
        <p>The history of the album comes from its roots in J. Cole’s intimate relationship with Fayetteville, North Carolina, and his adopted home, New York City. The album uses the city as a mirror, a temptation, a pressure cooker, and a pathway to redemption. It is one of the most urban-coded albums of his career. He focuses on the differences in each city’s personality and how those experiences shaped him personally. A main theme in the album is that urban environments provoke reflection and fuel his hunger for success. The golden crown resembles a saint's halo, but its spikes echo a devil's horns; even as it remains luxurious and bright. The album highlights the tension between city life and human morals: guilt vs. indulgence, God vs. temptation, and ambition vs. humility.</p>
