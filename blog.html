          <h2>Scrollable Thoughts...</h2>
            <h3>Houston</h3>
              <p>Houston felt like stepping into a collage of cultures stacked on top of each other in the best way. The heat hits first, but then it’s the people, the food, the murals, the conversations, you feel creativity everywhere. I remember walking through different neighborhoods, noticing how stories are told through color, sound, and community pride. Houston taught me that inspiration doesn’t always shout. Sometimes it’s slow, warm, and rooted in everyday moments.</p>
            <h3>Minneapolis/St. Paul (Twin Cities)</h3>
              <p>Minneapolis has this quiet beauty that pulls you in without trying. Maybe it’s the lakes, maybe it’s the music history, or maybe it’s the people who carry so much softness and strength at the same time. The creativity there feels emotional—shaped by long winters and deep community connections. I felt like every corner had something to say if you paid attention. Minneapolis taught me that calm places can still have the loudest creative voices.</p>
            <h3>Boston</h3>
              <p>Boston felt like a blend of past and future—old brick buildings sitting next to students from all over the world with ideas bigger than the skyline. I loved feeling the tension between tradition and growth. It made me think about how creativity often comes from contrast, from what used to be and what could be. Boston reminded me that ambition has its own energy, and it can push your imagination in ways you don’t expect.</p>
            <h3>Chicago</h3>
              <p>Chicago is full of motion. Trains, people, music, food—everything feels like it’s moving at the same rhythm. I felt that creative spark everywhere: in the architecture, in the neighborhoods, in the way people carry their stories. Chicago has this boldness to it, like the city knows its worth. Being there reminded me that creativity can be loud, gritty, proud, and still incredibly beautiful.</p>
            <h3>Denver</h3>
              <p>Denver felt different from the moment I landed. The air is lighter, the views are wider, and people seem to breathe a little deeper. Creativity there feels connected to nature, freedom, and finding space to think. Everyone I met had a story tied to the mountains or the outdoors somehow. Denver showed me that art doesn’t have to come from chaos—sometimes it comes from clarity and fresh air.</p>

            <h3>Orlando</h3>
              <p>Orlando surprised me. Beyond the theme parks, there’s a whole world of color, imagination, and storytelling woven into the city. It made me tap into the playful side of creativity—the kind that doesn’t take itself too seriously. I met people from everywhere, each carrying their own culture, language, and dreams. Orlando reminded me that creativity can be fun, bright, and unapologetically bold.</p>
            <h3>Louisville</h3>
              <p>Louisville felt warm in a way that was different from other cities I’ve visited. There’s a sense of pride there—heritage, craftsmanship, tradition—but also a rising creative scene that feels fresh. I loved how grounded the city felt and how memorable the people were. It reminded me that art can come from honoring where you’re from while still imagining where you’re going.</p>
            <h3>St. Louis</h3>
              <p>St. Louis felt raw and real. The city has a heartbeat you can feel through its jazz history, street art, and neighborhood energy. People there speak with passion—about their city, their teams, their stories. Creativity in St. Louis feels honest, shaped by both struggle and pride. Being there made me appreciate how powerful it is when a city’s art reflects the truth of its people.</p>
            <h3>Milwaukee</h3>
              <p>Milwaukee feels personal because it’s been home the past few years. It’s messy, creative, growing, and full of people who make the city what it is. From the lake to the neighborhoods, from festivals to murals, the culture is layered and constantly shifting. The city has shaped the way I see art, music, and design. Milwaukee taught me how place, people, and identity connect, and how creativity can grow from everyday life.</p>
            <h3>Duluth</h3>
              <p>Duluth has a quiet, rugged beauty that stays with you long after you leave. The city I grew up visiting. The cold air, the waves crashing against the rocks, the hills that make every view feel layered, it all creates this calm, creative clarity. There’s something about Lake Superior that makes you slow down and pay attention, like the water itself is reminding you to breathe. The people there feel grounded and genuine, shaped by weather, nature, and a lifestyle that moves at its own pace. Duluth showed me that creativity can come from stillness, from watching the lake shift colors, and from the kind of peace that only a northern city can give. It’s a place where inspiration doesn’t need noise, it just needs space.</p>
